# Benchmarker
Android Application to Benchmark Android-running databases

## Motivation
Test and publish a detailed performance report on various databases and ORM's supported on the Android Platform such that developers can make an informed choice

## Roadmap
* Generate performance / throughput test cases for db types
* Monitor and report the performance statistics for comparision
* Full Material Design

## Target DB/ORM's
### Databases
- [x] [Android SQLite](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/databases.html)
- [x] [Realm](http://realm.io)
- [ ] [SnappyDB](https://github.com/nhachicha/SnappyDB)

### ORM's *(based on SQLite)*
- [ ] [GreenDAO](http://greendao-orm.com)
- [ ] [OrmLite](http://ormlite.com/sqlite_java_android_orm.shtml)
- [ ] [SugarORM](http://satyan.github.io/sugar/index.html)
- [ ] [ActiveAndroid](http://www.activeandroid.com/)
- [ ] [DBFlow](https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow)


*Checkmarks indicate test cases updated till now*

## Further Planning
* Display detailed performance test report on separate webpage
* Publish in Google Play
* Real Time performance updates
